To understand git, you need to be aware of hash functions

We will build our own little git like system to learn how git uses the sha1 hash function.

A commit is a snapshot of all tracked files at a specific time. 

Every commit depends on the parent commit. 

Every branch is just a pointer to a commit.

Every tag is just a pointer to a commit.
